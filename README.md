# iotaa

**It's One Thing After Another**

A tiny workflow manager with semantics similar to those of [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) but with tasks defined as decorated Python functions. `iotaa` is pure Python, relies on no third-party packages, and is contained in a single module.

## Workflows

Workflows comprise:

- Assets (observable external state -- typically files, but sometimes more abstract state, e.g. a time duration)
- Requirement relationships between assets
- Executable logic to make assets ready (e.g. create them)

## Assets

An asset (an instance of class `iotaa.Asset`) has two attributes:

1. `ref`: A value, of any type, uniquely referring to the observable state this asset represents (e.g. a POSIX filesytem path, an S3 URI, an ISO8601 timestamp)
2. `ready`: A 0-arity (no-argument) function returning a `bool` indicating whether or not the asset is ready to use

Create an asset by calling `iotaa.asset()`.

## Tasks

Task are functions that declare, by `yield`ing values to `iotaa`, a description of the assets represented by the task (aka the task's name), plus -- depending on task type -- one or more of: the assets themselves, other tasks that the task requires, and/or executable logic to make the task's asset ready. `iotaa` provides three Python decorators to define tasks:

### `@task`

The essential workflow function type. A `@task` function `yield`s, in order:

1. A task name describing the assets being readied, for logging
2. An asset -- or an asset `list`, or a `dict` mapping `str` keys to assets, or `None` -- that the task is responsible for making ready
3. A task-function call (e.g. `t(args)` for task `t`) -- or a `list` or `dict` of such calls, or `None` -- that this task requires before it can ready its own assets

Arbitrary Python statements may appear before and interspersed between the `yield` statements. If the assets of all required tasks are ready, the statements following the third and final `yield` will be executed, with the expectation that they will make the task's assets ready.

### `@external`

A function type representing a required asset that `iotaa` cannot make ready, or a `list` or `dict` of such assets. An `@external` function `yield`s, in order:

1. A task name describing the assets being readied, for logging
2. A required asset -- or an asset `list`, or a `dict` mapping `str` keys to assets, or `None` -- that must become ready via external means not under workflow control. (Specifying `None` may be nonsensical.)

As with `@task` functions, arbitrary Python statements may appear before and interspersed between these `yield` statements. However, no statements should follow the second and final `yield`: They will never execute since `@external` tasks are intended as passive wrappers around external state.

### `@tasks`

A function type serving as a container for other tasks. A `@tasks` function `yield`s, in order:

1. A task name describing the assets being readied, for logging
2. A task-function call (e.g. `t(args)` for task `t`) -- or a `list` or `dict` of such calls, or `None` -- that this task requires. (Specifying `None` may be nonsensical.)

As with `@external` tasks, no statements should follow the second and final `yield`, as they will never execute.

## Use

### Installation

- In a conda environment: `conda install -c maddenp iotaa`, or
- In a Python `venv` environment, from the `src/` directory of an `iotaa` git clone: `pip install --prefix /path/to/venv .`, or
- Copy the `src/iotaa/__init__.py` module as `iotaa.py` to another project. No `iotaa` CLI program will be available in this case, but `iotaa.main()` can be used to create one.

### CLI Use

```
% iotaa --help
usage: iotaa [-d] [-h] [-g] [-v] module function [args ...]

positional arguments:
  module
    application module
  function
    task function
  args
    function arguments

optional arguments:
  -d, --dry-run
    run in dry-run mode
  -h, --help
    show help and exit
  -g, --graph
    emit Graphviz dot to stdout
  -v, --verbose
    verbose logging
```

Specifying positional arguments `m f hello 88` would call task function `f` in module `m` with arguments `hello: str` and `88: int`. (Positional arguments `args` are parsed with Python's `json` library into Python values.)

It is assumed that `m` is importable by Python due to being on `sys.path`, by any customary means, including via `PYTHONPATH`. However, if `m` -- more likely specified as `m.py` or `/path/to/m.py` -- is a valid absolute or relative (to the current directory) path to a file, its parent directory is automatically added by `iotaa` to `sys.path` so that it can be loaded, as a convenience.

A task tree of arbitrary complexity defined in module `m` may be entered at any point by specifying the appropriate task function `f`. Only `f` and its children will be (recursively) processed, resulting in partial execution of a potentially larger workflow graph.

### Programmatic Use

After installation, `import iotaa` for `from iotaa import ...` to access public members. See the demo application below for example use.

### Dry-Run Mode

Use the CLI `--dry-mode` switch (or call `dryrun()` programmatically) to run `iotaa` in a mode where no post-`yield` statements in `@task` bodies are executed. When applications are written such that no state-changing statements precede the final `yield` statement, dry mode will report the current condition of the workflow, pointing out pending requirements that block workflow progress.

## Helpers

Several public helper callables are available in the `iotaa` module:

- `asset()` instantiates an asset to return from a task function.
- `dryrun()` enables dry-run mode.
- `refs()` accepts a task object and returns a `dict` mapping `int` indexes (if the task `yield`s its assets as a `list` or as a single asset) or `str` (if the task `yield`s its assets as a `dict`) keys to the `ref` attributes of the task's assets.
- `logcfg()` configures Python's root logger to support `logging.info()` et al calls, which `iotaa` itself makes. It is called when the `iotaa` CLI is used, but could also be called by standalone applications with simple logging needs.
- `main()` is the entry-point function for CLI use.
- `run()` runs a command in a subshell -- functionality commonly needed in workflows.
- `runconda()` runs a command in a subshell with a named conda environment activated.

## Development

In the base environment of a conda installation ([Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) recommended), install the [condev](https://github.com/maddenp/condev) [package](https://anaconda.org/maddenp/condev), then run `make devshell` in the root of an `iotaa` git clone. See the [condev docs](https://github.com/maddenp/condev/blob/main/README.md) for details but, in short: In the development shell created by `make devshell`, one may edit and test code live (either by starting a `python` REPL, or by invoking the `iotaa` CLI program), run the auto-formatter with `make format`, and run the code-quality tests with `make test`. Type `exit` to exit the development shell. (The underlying `DEV-iotaa` conda environment created by `make devshell` will persist until manually removed, so future `make devshell` invocations should be much faster than the first one, which had to create this environment.)

## Notes

- Workflows can be invoked repeatedly, potentially making further progress with each invocation, depending on availability of external requirements. Since task functions' assets are checked for readiness before their requirements are checked or their post-`yield` statements are executed, completed work is never performed twice -- unless the asset becomes un-ready via external means. For example, one might notice that an asset is incorrect, remove it, fix the workflow code, then re-run the workflow; `iotaa` would perform whatever work is necessary to re-ready the asset, but nothing more.
- A task may be instantiated in statements before the statement `yield`ing it to `iotaa`, but note that control will pass to it immediately. For example, a task might have, instead of the statement `yield foo(x)`, the separate statements `foo_assets = foo(x)` (first) and `yield foo` (later). In this case, control would be passed to `foo` (and potentially to a tree of tasks it requires) immediately upon evaluation of the expression `foo(x)`. This should be fine semantically, but be aware of the order of execution it implies.
- For its dry-run mode to work correctly, `iotaa` assumes that no statements that change external state execute before the final `yield` statement in a task-function's body.
- Tasks are cached and only executed once in the lifetime of the Python interpreter, so it is currently assumed that `iotaa` or an application embedding it will be invoked repeatedly (or, in happy cases, just once) to complete all tasks, with the Python interpreter exiting and restarting with each invocation. Support could be added to clear cached tasks to support applications that would run workflows repeatedly inside the same interpreter invocation. NB: Caching requires all arguments to task functions to be hashable.
- Currently, `iotaa` is single-threaded, so it truly is "one thing after another". Concurrency for execution of mutually independent tasks could be added, but presumably requirement relationships would still exist between some tasks, so partial ordering and serialization would usually still exist.
- Currently, `iotaa` relies on Python's root logger. Support could be added for optional alternative use of a logger supplied by an application.

## Demo

Consider the source code of the [demo application](src/iotaa/demo.py), which simulates making a cup of tea (according to [the official recipe](https://www.google.com/search?q=masters+of+reality+t.u.s.a.+lyrics)).

The first `@tasks` method defines the end result: A cup of tea, steeped, with sugar -- and a spoon to stir in the sugar:

``` python
@tasks
def a_cup_of_tea(basedir):
    # A cup of steeped tea with sugar, and a spoon.
    yield "The perfect cup of tea"
    yield [spoon(basedir), steeped_tea_with_sugar(basedir)]
```

As described above, a `@tasks` function must `yield` its name and the assets it requires: In this case, the steeped tea with sugar, and a spoon. Since this function is a `@tasks` connection, no executable statements follow the final `yield.`

The `spoon()` and `cup()` `@task` functions are straightforward:

``` python
@task
def spoon(basedir):
    # A spoon to stir the tea.
    path = Path(basedir) / "spoon"
    yield "A spoon"
    yield asset(path, path.exists)
    yield None
    path.parent.mkdir(parents=True)
    path.touch()
```

``` python
@task
def cup(basedir):
    # A cup for the tea.
    path = Path(basedir) / "cup"
    yield "A cup"
    yield asset(path, path.exists)
    yield None
    path.mkdir(parents=True)
```

They `yield` their names; the asset each is responsible for making ready; and the tasks they require -- `None` in this case, since they have no requirements. Following the final `yield`, they do what is necessary to ready their assets: `spoon()` ensures that the base directory exists, then creates the `spoon` file therein; `cup()` creates the `cup` directory that will contain the tea ingredients.

Note that, while `pathlib`'s `Path.mkdir()` would normally raise an exception if the specified directory already exists (unless an `exist_ok=True` argument is supplied), the workflow need not explicitly account for this possibility because `iotaa` checks for the readiness of assets before executing code that would ready them. That is, `iotaa` will not execute the `path.mkdir()` statement if it determines that the asset represented by that directoy is already ready (i.e. exists). This check is provided by the `path.exists` function supplied as the second argument to `asset()` in `cup()`.

The `steeped_tea_with_sugar()` `@task` function is next:

``` python
@task
def steeped_tea_with_sugar(basedir):
    # Add sugar to the steeped tea. Requires tea to have steeped.
    for x in ingredient(basedir, "sugar", "Sugar", steeped_tea):
        yield x
```

Two new ideas are demonstrated here.

First, a task function can call arbitrary logic to help it carry out its duties. In this case, it calls an `ingredient()` helper function defined thus:

``` python
def ingredient(basedir, fn, name, req=None):
    yield f"{name} in cup"
    path = refs(cup(basedir)) / fn
    yield {fn: asset(path, path.exists)}
    yield [cup(basedir)] + ([req(basedir)] if req else [])
    logging.info("Adding %s to cup", fn)
    path.touch()
```

This helper is called by other task functions in the workflow, too. It simulates adding an ingredient (tea, water, sugar) to the tea cup, and `yield`s values that the caller can re-`yield` to `iotaa`.

Second, `steeped_tea_with_sugar()` `yield`s (indirectly, by passing it to `ingredient()`) a requirement: Sugar is added as a last step after the tea is steeped, so `steeped_tea_with_sugar()` requires `steeped_tea()`. Note that it passes the function _name_ rather than a call (i.e. `steeped_tea` instead of `steeped_tea(basedir)`) so that it can be called at the right time by `ingredient()`.

Next up, the `steeped_tea()` function, which is more complex:

``` python
@task
def steeped_tea(basedir):
    # Give tea time to steep.
    yield "Steeped tea"
    water = refs(steeping_tea(basedir))["water"]
    steep_time = lambda x: asset("elapsed time", lambda: x)
    t = 10  # seconds
    if water.exists():
        water_poured_time = dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(water.stat().st_mtime)
        ready_time = water_poured_time + dt.timedelta(seconds=t)
        now = dt.datetime.now()
        ready = now >= ready_time
        remaining = int((ready_time - now).total_seconds())
        yield steep_time(ready)
    else:
        ready = False
        remaining = t
        yield steep_time(False)
    yield steeping_tea(basedir)
    if not ready:
        logging.warning("Tea needs to steep for %ss", remaining)
```

Here, the asset being `yield`ed is more abstract: It represents a certain amount of time having passed since the boiling water was poured over the tea. (The observant reader will note that 10 seconds is insufficient, if handy for a demo. Try 3 minutes for black tea IRL.) The path to the `water` file is located by calling `refs()` on the return value of `steeping_tea()` and taking the item with key `water` (because `ingredient()` `yield`s its assets as `{fn: asset(path, path.exists)}`, where `fn` is the filename, e.g. `sugar`, `teabag`, `water`.) If the water was poured long enough ago, `steeped_tea` is ready; if not, it should be during some future execution of this workflow. Note that the executable code following the final `yield` only logs information: There's nothing this task can do to make its asset (time passed) ready: It can only wait.

Note the statement

``` python
water = refs(steeping_tea(basedir))["water"]
```

Here, `steeped_tea()` needs to know the path to the `water` file, and obtains it by calling the `steeping_tea()` task, extracting the references to its assets with `iotaa`'s `refs()` function, and selecting the `"water"` item's reference, which is the path to the `water` file. This is a useful way to delegate ownership of knowledge about assets to those assets, but note that the function call `steeping_tea(basedir)` effectively transfers workflow control to that task. This can be seen in the execution traces shown later in this document, where the task responsible for the `water` file (as well as its requirements) are evaluated before the steep-time task.

The `steeping_tea()` and `teabag()` functions are again straightforward `@task`s, leveraging the `ingredient()` helper:

``` python
@task
def steeping_tea(basedir):
    # Pour boiling water over the tea. Requires teabag in cup.
    for x in ingredient(basedir, "water", "Boiling water", teabag):
        yield x
```

``` python
@task
def teabag(basedir):
    # Place tea bag in the cup. Requires box of teabags.
    for x in ingredient(basedir, "teabag", "Teabag", box_of_teabags):
        yield x
```

Finally, we have this workflow's only `@external` task, `box_of_teabags()`. The idea here is that this is something that simply must exist (think: someone must have simply bought the box of teabags at the store), and no action by the workflow can create it. Unlike other task types, the `@external` `yield`s, after its name, only the _assets_ that it represents. It `yield`s no task requirements, and has no executable statements to make the asset ready:

``` python
@external
def box_of_teabags(basedir):
    path = Path(basedir) / "box-of-teabags"
    yield f"Box of teabags {path}"
    yield asset(path, path.exists)
```

Let's run this workflow with the `iotaa` command-line tool, requesting that the workflow start with the `a_cup_of_tea` task:

```

```

There's lots to see during the first invocation. Most of the tasks start and end in a pending state. Only the `spoon()` and `cup()` tasks make progress from `Pending` to `Ready` states:

```
[2023-10-19T11:49:43] INFO    A spoon: Initial state: Pending

[2023-10-19T11:49:43] INFO    A cup: Final state: Ready
```

We will see in subsequent workflow invocations that these tasks are not revisited, as their assets will be found to be ready.

The on-disk workflow state is:

```
% tree teatime
teatime
├── cup
└── spoon
```

Note the blocker:

```
[2023-10-19T11:49:43] WARNING Box of teabags teatime/box-of-teabags: State: Pending (EXTERNAL)
```

The file `teatime/box-of-teabags` cannot be created by the workflow, as it is declared `@external`. Let's create it externally:

```
% touch teatime/box-of-teabags
% tree teatime/
teatime/
├── box-of-teabags
├── cup
└── spoon
```

Now let's iterate the workflow:

```

On-disk workflow state now:

```
% tree teatime
teatime
├── box-of-teabags
├── cup
│   ├── teabag
│   └── water
└── spoon
```

Since the box of tea became available, the workflow was able to add tea to the cup and pour boiling water over it. Note the message `Tea needs to steep for 9s`. If we iterate the workflow again after a few seconds, we can see the steep time decreasing:

```
% iotaa iotaa.demo a_cup_of_tea ./teatime
...
[2023-10-19T11:52:12] WARNING Tea needs to steep for 6s
...
```

If we wait a bit longer and iterate:

```
% iotaa iotaa.demo a_cup_of_tea ./teatime
[2023-10-19T11:53:49] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Initial state: Pending

[2023-10-19T11:53:49] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Final state: Ready
```

Now that the tea has steeped long enough, the sugar has been added:

```
% tree teatime
teatime
├── box-of-teabags
├── cup
│   ├── sugar
│   ├── teabag
│   └── water
└── spoon
```

One more iteration and we see that the workflow has reached its final state and takes no more action:

```
% iotaa iotaa.demo a_cup_of_tea ./teatime
[2023-10-19T11:54:32] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Initial state: Pending
[2023-10-19T11:54:32] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Checking requirements
[2023-10-19T11:54:32] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Final state: Ready
```

Since `a_cup_of_tea()` is a `@tasks` _collection_, its state is contingent on that of its required tasks, so its readiness check will always involve checking requirements, unlike a non-collection `@task`, which can just check its assets.

One useful feature of this kind of workflow is its ability to recover from damage to its external state. Here, we remove the sugar from the tea (don't try this at home):

```
% rm -v teatime/cup/sugar

Note how the workflow detects the change to the readiness of its assets and recovers:

```
% iotaa iotaa.demo a_cup_of_tea ./teatime
[2023-10-19T11:55:45] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Initial state: Pending
[2023-10-19T11:55:45] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Checking requirements

```

% tree teatime

│   ├── sugar
│   ├── teabag
│   └── water
└── spoon
```

Another useful feature is the ability to enter the workflow's task graph at an arbitrary point to obtain only a subset of the assets. For example, if we'd like a cup of tea _without_ sugar, we can start with the `steeped_tea` task rather than the higher-level `a_cup_of_tea` task.

First, let's empty the cup:

```
% rm -v teatime/cup/*
removed 'teatime/cup/sugar'
removed 'teatime/cup/teabag'
removed 'teatime/cup/water'
% tree teatime/
teatime/
├── box-of-teabags
├── cup
└── spoon
```

Now request tea without sugar:

```
% iotaa iotaa.demo steeped_tea ./teatime
% iotaa iotaa.demo steeped_tea ./teatime
[2023-10-19T11:57:31] INFO    Boiling water in cup: Initial state: Pending

```

After waiting for the tea to steep:

```
% iotaa iotaa.demo steeped_tea ./teatime
2023-10-19T11:57:57] INFO    Steeped tea: Initial state: Ready
```

On-disk state:

## Graphing

The `-g` / `--graph` switch can be used to emit to `stdout` a description of the current state of the workflow graph in [Grapviz](https://graphviz.org/) [DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) format. Here, for example, the preceding demo workflow is executed in dry-run mode with graph output requested, and the graph document rendered as an SVG image by `dot` and displayed by the Linux utility `display`:

```
% iotaa --dry-run --graph iotaa.demo a_cup_of_tea ./teatime | display <(dot -T svg)
[2023-10-19T12:13:47] INFO    The perfect cup of tea: Initial state: Pending
...
[2023-10-19T12:13:47] WARNING The perfect cup of tea: Final state: Pending
```

The displayed image (ready assets are shown in green, pending ones in orange):

![teatime-dry-run-image](img/teatime-0.svg)

Removing `--dry-run` and following the first phase of the demo tutorial in the previous section, the following succession of graph images are shown:

First run, blocked by missing (external) box of tea:

![teatime-dry-run-image](img/teatime-1.svg)

Second run, with box of tea available:

![teatime-dry-run-image](img/teatime-2.svg)

Third run, waiting for tea to steep:

![teatime-dry-run-image](img/teatime-3.svg)

Fourth run, with sugar added to steeped tea:

![teatime-dry-run-image](img/teatime-4.svg)

Fifth run, showing final sate:

![teatime-dry-run-image](img/teatime-5.svg)
